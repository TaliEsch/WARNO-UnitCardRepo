This is a repository to store PNG files for every unit in the game

Unit cards are stored using the unit's descriptor as the file name

Please report any errors, (margin issues/wrong unit/etc...) either with a Pull Request or by messaging Tali#9743 on discord

 

 

 

 

ps. Thank you very much to the following people

* Perytron for WARNO-DATA, which was very useful when decoding the ndfs (https://github.com/Perytron/WARNO-DATA)
